# fantalegheEV-ui
This is a basic UI for the fantalegheEV project. Refer to this [fantalegheEV-api](https://github.com/antpas14/fantalegheEV-api) for more information.

### Sites screenshots
UI is quite basic and just requires the league name to be passed through the form

![Homepage](docs/images/fantaleghe_empty.png)

Then click on the calculate button

![After calculation](docs/images/fantaleghe_filled.png)

After calculation is made, rank will appear on bottom. It contains:
* points calculated by the algorithm
* actual point earned by the team
* difference between them

A *positive* difference gives an estimate on how the team has been *lucky* until now. Otherwise, a *negative* difference gives an estimate on how the team has been *unlucky*.
